MadWimax is a reverse-engineered linux driver for Mobile Wimax (802.16e) devices based on Samsung CMC-730 chip.

This release is patched for lithuanian Mobile WiMAX network MEZON.

Just insert Samsung SWC-U200 USB dongle. Udev starts madwimax, connects to MEZON and gets DHCP lease. On success both leds will turn blue.
